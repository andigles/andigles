# Hi, I'm AndrÃ©s ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ¯ Transitioning into **Machine Learning / MLOps** â€” I build small, reproducible projects using Python, SQL, and simple cloud tooling.

## Selected projects
- [Bikeshare Analysis (Python)](https://github.com/andigles/bikeshare-mini) â€” CLI analysis with tiny sample data, tests, and CI (continuous integration).
- [Finding Donors â€” In Progress (notebook)](https://github.com/andigles/finding_donors) â€” Udacity ML project; working locally in `starter/finding_donors.ipynb`. Portfolio polish/CI will follow after completion.
- [Dog Breed (PyTorch)](https://github.com/andigles/dog-breed-pretrained) â€” CLI to evaluate pretrained models on pet images; prints per-model accuracy and writes results.csv in one command.

## What I value
- **Reproducibility**: every repo runs from a clean clone
- **Plain language**: define any acronym the first time
- **Evidence**: tests, CI badges, and small sample data

## Focus / learning
FastAPI â€¢ Docker â€¢ SQL (DuckDB/Postgres) â€¢ MLflow â€¢ Prefect
