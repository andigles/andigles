# Hi, I'm Andrés 👋

🎯 Transitioning into **Machine Learning / MLOps** — I build small, reproducible projects using Python, SQL, and simple cloud tooling.

## Selected projects
- [Flower Image Classifier (PyTorch)](https://github.com/andigles/flower-image-classifier) — Train from a saved checkpoint + CLI prediction (top-K). Clear setup + reproducible run steps.
- [Finding Donors — Case Study (scikit-learn)](https://github.com/andigles/finding-donors-ml) — Income prediction with model comparison, tuning, and clear write-up (F0.5-focused).  
  - Read the report (HTML): https://github.com/andigles/finding-donors-ml/blob/main/notebooks/finding_donors.html
- [Bikeshare Analysis (Python)](https://github.com/andigles/bikeshare-mini) — CLI analysis with tiny sample data, tests, and CI (continuous integration).
- [Dog Breed (PyTorch)](https://github.com/andigles/dog-breed-pretrained) — CLI to evaluate pretrained models on pet images; prints per-model accuracy and writes `results.csv` in one command.

## What I value
- **Reproducibility**: every repo runs from a clean clone
- **Plain language**: define any acronym the first time
- **Evidence**: tests, CI badges, and clear run steps

## Focus / learning
FastAPI • Docker • SQL (DuckDB/Postgres) • MLflow • Prefect
