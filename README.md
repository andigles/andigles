# Hi, I'm Andrés 👋

I’m transitioning into **Machine Learning / MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)**.  
I build small, reproducible projects using **Python**, **SQL**, and simple automation.

## Selected projects
- **[Flower Image Classifier (PyTorch)](https://github.com/andigles/flower-image-classifier)** — Train and run predictions from the command line (top-K). Includes clear setup steps and an automated run check.
- **[Finding Donors (scikit-learn)](https://github.com/andigles/finding-donors-ml)** — Supervised learning case study to predict >$50K income with model comparison and tuning.  
  Report (HTML): **[andigles.github.io/finding-donors-ml](https://andigles.github.io/finding-donors-ml/)**
- **[Bikeshare Analysis (Python)](https://github.com/andigles/bikeshare-mini)** — Command-line data analysis with a small sample dataset, tests, and **CI (Continuous Integration)**.
- **[Dog Breed Classifier (PyTorch)](https://github.com/andigles/dog-breed-pretrained)** — Command-line evaluation of pretrained models; prints per-model accuracy and writes `results.csv`.

## What I value
- **Reproducibility**: every repo runs from a clean clone
- **Plain language**: define acronyms the first time
- **Evidence**: tests, CI checks, and clear run steps

## Focus / learning
FastAPI • Docker • SQL (DuckDB, Postgres) • MLflow • Prefect
